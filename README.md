<h1>Team Github Utilization and Compliance</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this project is to assess the effectiveness of utilizing GitHub as the team's code repository and review tool.  The team has established protocols that require the submission of pull requests and subsequent code reviews under specific circumstances.  This analysis aims to compare the expected number of pull requests and internal cases requiring such submissions, against the actual number of pull requests and reviews conducted.  Ultimately, this project seeks to evaluate the team's adherence to the established processes for code repository usage and code review practices.

<h2>Project Questions: </h2>h2>
- How has the team's usage of GitHub changed over time?  What is the trend over the past ___ quarters or years? Is there a reason for this? <br>
- How has the team's usage of GitHub changed over time?  What is the trend over the past ___ quarters or years? Is there a reason for this? <br>
- Are we utilizing Github as our code review tool as intended, or are we defaulting to other tools and methods? <br>
- How does the number of internal cases requiring a code review submission compare to the actual number of pull requests? Which cases didn't have a pull request that should have? <br>
- Are there certain types of internal cases that are more susceptible to not receiving a pull request?  Why is this? <br> 
- How many commits are pushed per pull request, on average? Are we commiting new code after it has been reviewed by the team? <br>
- Are there pull requests that have not been reviewed and have no comments on them?  How many comments or reviewers does each pull request receive, on average? <br>
- Who is contributing the most to the health of our repositories?  Who is not following our established protocols for code reviews? <br>
- Is code actually being merged when finallized? <br>    
- What type of contributions does the team need to improve? For example, are we good at leaving reviews on code but bad about committing new code after a review? <br>
- Is the lack of contribution to the repository because of a training or process gap?  How can we fill this gap and support eachother better as a team? <br>
     

Project Questions:
  -  To successfully complete this project, I employ a Python script that interacts with the GitHub Rest API.  By iterating through four endpoints over two repositories, I extract unstructured data pertaining to commits, pull requests, and review comments.  The data is then compiled into structured dataframes, and the output is eventually transferred to an Excel spreadsheet.  This spreadsheet loads into PowerBI where the data goes through an in depth process of transformation and manipulation using PowerQuery.  Utilizing clean data,
